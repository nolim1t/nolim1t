### Hi there 👋 and welcome to the new facebook

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **self-sovereign freedomtech projects** as well **open source** that is builds are **fully verifiable**. I'm also available for hire for freelance type work in the blockchain space.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my [Golang](https://gitlab.com/nolim1t/golang-httpd-test) so that I can leverage it to build lean, and self-sovereign coinjoin applications like JoinMarket / lightning pool so people can rent their bitcoin liquidity for a fee! (Make money while you sleep and not get scammed!)
